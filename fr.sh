#Shell script to perform a find and replace operation in multiple files using tools like sed (stream 
editor) or grep (with perl regex). Below is an example using sed to perform a find and replace 
operation:

#!/bin/bash

# Define variables
SEARCH_STRING="old_string"
REPLACE_STRING="new_string"
FILES_DIR="/path/to/files/directory"

# Perform find and replace using sed
find "$FILES_DIR" -type f -exec sed -i "s/$SEARCH_STRING/$REPLACE_STRING/g" {} +
echo "Find and replace complete!"

#Here's how the script works:
#1. Shebang (#!/bin/bash): Specifies the shell to be used for interpreting the script.
#2. Variable Definitions: Define variables for the search string, replace string, and the 
directory where the files are located. Adjust these variables based on your needs.
#3. Perform Find and Replace: The find command searches for files in the specified 
directory ($FILES_DIR). For each file found, it runs sed -i to perform an in-place find 
and replace operation using the provided search and replace strings. The -i flag 
modifies the file in place.
#The s/$SEARCH_STRING/$REPLACE_STRING/g argument to sed is the substitution 
pattern, where $SEARCH_STRING is replaced with $REPLACE_STRING. The g flag at the 
end ensures that all occurrences of the search string in each line are replaced.
#4. Completion Message: Outputs a message indicating that the find and replace 
operation is complete.
